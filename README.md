# 100_programs
I'm doing 100 programs while learning how to code
I started this journy around November 20th 2020.
My goal with all of this is to gain the knowlage needed for employment using this file to show my progression while watching a guide.
The guide I followed for this was a youtube series of 
"Learn to program in 100 days by programing"

It took me this long to figure out how to use github I guess so wish me luck!
